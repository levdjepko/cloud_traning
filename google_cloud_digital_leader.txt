GCP has a lot of common terminology with AWS and maybe Azure 
#
Elasticity is an important thing in the cloud
When answering the questions, make sure to do the “best practices”
CapEx - on-premise vs Op-Ex - in cloud
Google owns its own subsea cables across the world
Network edge - where we connect to the network

IaaS - computing resources on demand (Bare Metal)
PaaS - complete environments (AppSheets…)
SaaS - the software is centrally hosted and accessed (Gmail, Docs, etc.)

Firestore is the fast NoSQL DB
NoSQL - AI/ML, BigTable
Object storage - image
BigQuery - data warehouse; serverless; multi-cloud; scalable; relational (no images)
Data Warehouse = noSQL
Migrating the DB -> Lift And Shift ; Replatforming; refactoring; retiring/replacing
Looker = PowerBI. Works with BigQuery
Pub/Sub - service that sends and receives
Dataflow = Databricks 

AI and ML
AI > ML > DL
Pre-trained APIs, then AutoML, then Custom built like Vertex
BigQueryML - allows users to run queries with SQL in this SaaS product
AutoML - doesn’t require any expertise in AI models, easy to build quick Ml model
Vertex - more low-level AI/ML solution
Apogee - API management system

VMs:
	Compute Engine = VMs
	VMWare Engine
	Bare Metal - you are responsible for managing infrastructure (don’t share machines with any other app)
Containers:
	GKE - Containers and Kubernetes
Serverless:
	Cloud Run - serverless containers; 
	Cloud Functions - functions as a service; process images or anything like that
	App Engine - PaaS to develop and host web apps; any programming language (outdated)
Servers -> CMs (on premises) -> IaaS -> Containers
API can help modernize the legacy systems. API is a gateway to get to the back-end legacy system
Apigee tool is used to manage APIs
